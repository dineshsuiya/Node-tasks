1.What’s the difference between path.join() and path.resolve()?
| Feature                | `path.join()`                     | `path.resolve()`                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Returns                | Normalized path (may be relative) | Always absolute path                                    |
| Base directory         | Just joins parts                  | Starts from current working directory (`process.cwd()`) |
| Stops at absolute path | Yes (keeps that segment only)     | Yes (resolves from there)                               |
| Use case               | Combine parts safely              | Get full absolute path                                  |


2. What’s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous fs methods?
	
(I). Synchronous fs methods

Block the code execution until the file operation is completed.

The program waits for the task to finish before moving to the next line.

Denoted by the “Sync” suffix in method names.
(II). Asynchronous fs methods

Do not block the code execution.

Other code runs while the file operation is in progress.

Use callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle results.

(III).difference between synchronous and asynchronous.
| Feature     | Synchronous (`Sync`)                    | Asynchronous                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Execution   | Blocks code                             | Non-blocking                 |
| Performance | Slower (for large files)                | Faster & efficient           |
| Naming      | Ends with “Sync” (e.g., `readFileSync`) | No “Sync” (e.g., `readFile`) |
| Use Case    | Small scripts, one-time tasks           | Servers, I/O-heavy apps      |


3.Why is nodemon used in backend development?
| Benefit                      | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
|	Auto restart           | Automatically restarts your server when files change. |
| 	Saves time             | No need to stop/start Node manually after every edit. |
| 	Easy setup             | Simple to install and use (`npm install -g nodemon`). |
| 	Great for development  | Keeps your development process smooth and fast.       |

4.What are the advantages of using process module?

|  Feature                                                  Description                                                                             
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |                                                                          | 
|  Access environment variables       | You can use `process.env` to access environment variables (like DB passwords, ports, etc.) |                          
|  Handle command-line arguments      | Get user inputs passed in terminal                                                         |                           
|  Control program exit               | Gracefully stop the process using `process.exit()`                                         |                                          
|  Monitor performance                | Check memory usage or CPU time                                                             |                       
|  Handle events and errors           | Listen for `uncaughtException` or exit events to handle errors cleanly                     |          
|  Know the current working directory | Helps to build correct file paths                                                          |                            
|  Manage signals (like CTRL+C)       | Handle OS-level signals safely                                                             |
